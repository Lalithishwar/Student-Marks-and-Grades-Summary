# Student Marks and Grades Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a Python program that calculates and summarizes student marks and grades. It takes inputs of student names and their marks in three subjects - Math, Science, and English. The program computes total and average marks, assigns grades based on the average, calculates the class average, and identifies the topper (highest scorer).

## Features
- Input student details: names and marks for Math, Science, and English
- Calculates total marks and average score per student
- Assigns grades using a standard grading scale:
  - A: 90 and above
  - B: 80 to 89
  - C: 70 to 79
  - D: 60 to 69
  - F: below 60
- Computes class average score
- Identifies and highlights the topper
- Outputs a neat tabular summary of all students

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Optional: pandas and tabulate for enhanced table formatting (install via `pip install pandas tabulate`)

### How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
git clone <your-repo-url>

text
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd <project-directory>

text
3. Run the program:
python main.py

text
4. Enter the number of students and their details as prompted or provide a CSV file (if implemented).

## Sample Input
| Name  | Math | Science | English |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| Alice | 85   | 90      | 88      |
| Bob   | 78   | 83      | 75      |

## Sample Output
| Name  | Math | Science | English | Total | Average | Grade |
|-------|------|---------|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| Alice | 85   | 90      | 88      | 263   | 87.67   | B     |
| Bob   | 78   | 83      | 75      | 236   | 78.67   | C     |

**Class Average:** 83.17  
**Topper:** Alice (Total Marks: 263)
